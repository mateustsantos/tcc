2005-01-28  Felipe Vieira Klein  <felipe.klein@ic.unicamp.br>
   Modified files:

	* src/base/util/psc_randgen.{h, cpp}: added a function that
   sort a random number with the number of bits specified.
   The configure files were also modified to include the math
   library.

2004-12-19  Felipe Vieira Klein  <felipe.klein@ic.unicamp.br>
   Modified files:

	* src/base/psc_sampler.{h, cpp}: added a method that returns
   the total monitored time and some other minor changes.
	* src/base/psc_obj_rep.cpp: changed the method print_entries,
   to printout the total and average transition counts, and also
   to inform if the simulation was sampled or not.

2004-12-16  Felipe Vieira Klein  <felipe.klein@ic.unicamp.br>
   Added files:
   
	* src/base/psc_objinfo_if.h: interface methods to the
   psc_objinfo class.

   Modified files:

	* src/powersc.h: added the macro PSC_FULL_SAMPLING
	* src/base/psc_obj_rep.{h, cpp}: added the method full_sampling,
   changed some member variable declarations and adapted the
   class psc_obj_repository to use the pointer to the psc_objinfo
   interface.
	* src/base/psc_objinfo.h: modified the updating method that
   posts the toggle count information to the power objects database.
   The class psc_objinfo was modified to implement the interface
   psc_objinfo_if.
	* src/base/psc_sampler.{h, cpp}: added the capability to
   use (or not) the monitoring of the full simulation.

2004-12-15  Felipe Vieira Klein  <felipe.klein@ic.unicamp.br>
   Added files:
   
	* src/base/psc_obj_rep_base.h: interface methods defined in
   the class psc_obj_repository_base. These methods must be
   implemented by its derived class (psc_obj_repository).
   These methods define the public API seen by the psc_sampler
   class (See below).

   Modified files:
   
	* src/powersc.h: removed the macro that instantiates the
   psc_sampler object (deprecated).   
	* src/base/psc_sampler.{h, cpp}: Implemented the main class and
   the algorithm responsible to manage the sampling of the simulation.
	* src/base/psc_obj_rep.{h, cpp}: adapted the psc_obj_repository
   class to work together with the psc_sampler class. Also, it has been
   added methods to compute the total and average toggle counts gathered.
	* src/base/psc_objinfo.h: adapted the psc_objinfo class to work together
   with the psc_sampler class.


2004-12-07  Felipe Vieira Klein  <felipe.klein@ic.unicamp.br>

   Added the module psc_sampler, responsible for sample
   toggle counts throughout the simulation.
   
   Changed the registration of the psc_objinfo object
   from its destruction to the first time it is used.

   Updated configure.in and Makefile.am.

2004-12-03  Felipe Vieira Klein  <felipe.klein@ic.unicamp.br>
   More performance improvements.

	* src/base/psc_objinfo.h: only set an ID for the object
   when it is used, ignoring temporary objects.
	* src/psc_signal.h: force the setting of an ID for the object
   previously to its use.
	* src/psc_bit.{h, cpp}: minor changes

2004-12-02  Felipe Vieira Klein  <felipe.klein@ic.unicamp.br>
   Modifications in the update_toggle_count to improve simulation
   performance.
   
	* src/psc_bv.h: updated bit_diff to use the pre-calculated toggle
   counts from psc_tables.
	* src/base/psc_objinfo.h: replaced the pending stack for two member
   variables to hold the previous and the new value for the object.
