------------ PowerSC - A SystemC Extension for Power ------------

Author: Felipe Klein <klein@ic.unicamp.br>

This is the release 0.9.0 of the PowerSC Library, a SystemC 
extension developed aiming at the power analysis/optimization 
of SystemC models.

PowerSC is currently an ongoing project at the Computer Systems 
Laboratory (LSC), located at the Institute of Computing, 
UNICAMP, Brazil.

For further information about the LSC, other projects and 
so on, please refer to: http://www.lsc.ic.unicamp.br

Any comments, problems and suggestions regarding the PowerSC,
feel free to contact the author.

1. Installation
---------------

Please read the INSTALL file.

2. Examples
-----------

After the installation, if it was succesful, you will have
the example models under the directory 'examples/' built
and ready to run with PowerSC.

But if you want to use the usual SystemC executable 
specification, just type the following command under the
desired example directory

	make clean all-sc

This command builds the model without the PowerSC.

2. User Documentation
---------------------

We have no user documentation yet. Sorry for the inconvenience.
Please refer to the release notes below for some information
about this release.

3. Release Notes
----------------

Current PowerSC release, 0.9.0, has been tested under the following 
platform:
 - OS: Linux (2.4.x, 2.6.x)
 - GCC versions: 3.3.x
 - SystemC release: 2.1 (not the 2.1.v1)


PowerSC works for SystemC models, and we have the following
supported types:
 - sc_signal
 - sc_uint
 - sc_int
 - sc_logic
 - sc_bit
 - sc_lv
 - sc_bv
 - sc_clock


Known limitation:
 - You cannot use 'sensitive_pos' or 'sensitive_neg' for data types
 like sc_uint, sc_int and others in PowerSC. This is only available
 for the sc_clock type. 

To overcome this situation, currently we need to modify the code in
the sc_sensitive SystemC class. We do not intend to do that, but to
provide a solution without modifying any line of the SystemC code. 
We hope to solve this problem as soon as possible.
