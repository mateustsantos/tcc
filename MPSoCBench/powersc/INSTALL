1. Installation on Linux
------------------------

System requirements:
 - Mandatory: gcc, SystemC and make (gmake)
 - Optional: aclocal, autoconf, autoheader, automake

We assume you have properly installed the SystemC Library and
other tools like make, autoconf, automake, and so on.

1a. Basic Installation
----------------------

To install PowerSC on Linux, do the following steps:

 1. Untar the PowerSC release file
 
	tar zxf powersc-0.9.0.tar.gz

 2. Change to the just created directory
 
	cd powersc-0.9.0/

 3. Run the 'configure' script specifying the SystemC
    installation directory to generate the Makefiles
    
   ./configure --with-systemcdir=DIR

 4. Build the library
 
	make

 5. Install it
 
	make install

 6. Clean temporary object files
 
	make clean

Now you should have the PowerSC Library installed under 
the default installation directory (/usr/local/powersc).

1b. Customized Installation
---------------------------

You can override several default installation parameters by
using the 'configure' script.

For example, if you wish to install PowerSC in a
directory named PSC_DIR instead of the default value, you
could use

   --prefix=PSC_DIR

Regarding PowerSC, the available parameters are:
 - To specify where SystemC is installed
 
   --with-systemcdir=DIR
   
   where DIR stands for the SystemC directory

 - To build the PowerSC library for debugging
 
   --enable-debug

 - To enable tracing (debugging purposes)
 
   --enable-trace=LEVEL
   
   where LEVEL can be L1, L2, L3 or all

After running 'configure' with the desired parameters
set, just do the steps 4 through 6 from the 
'Basic Installation' procedure above in order to
build the PowerSC library.
